# Message for You

This is a fun and interactive HTML page where you are asked: **"Will you go out with me?"**. The page features two buttons, **"Yes"** and **"No"**, but here's the catch: **you can only select "Yes"**, which is the funny part of the project!

## Features
- A fun and engaging question: **"Will you go out with me?"**.

- Two buttons: **"Yes"** and **"No"**. However, you can only click **"Yes"**.

## Technologies Used
